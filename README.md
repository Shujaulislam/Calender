# React Calendar Application

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Features

- Monthly calendar view
- Resource management
- Event creation and management
- Drag and drop events
- Dark mode support
- Responsive design

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or later)
- npm (v6.0.0 or later)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-calendar-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd react-calendar-app
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
### OR

1. download the repository: 
   zip file and extract it.

2.  right click and open terminal in the folder and run this command:
   ```
   code .
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd react-calendar-app
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```   ```

## Running the Application

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5173` (or the port number displayed in your terminal).

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, run:

```
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder with the production-ready files.

## Additional Scripts

- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint to check for code quality and style issues
- `npm run preview`: Preview the production build locally

## Technologies Used

- React
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- date-fns
- react-draggable
- react-resizable

## Project Insights

### Key Learnings

1. **Logic Building**: Developed complex logic for calendar functionality and event management.
2. **Context API and Theming**: Implemented theme management using React's Context API.
3. **Grid Functionality**: Mastered CSS Grid and its integration with dynamic elements and events.
4. **Drag and Drop**: Implemented advanced drag and drop functionality, including state management and date handling.

### Challenges

The most challenging aspect was implementing the grid system and drag-and-drop functionality. This required a complete rewrite of the application within a tight three-day deadline.

### Future Improvements

Given more time, the following enhancements would be considered:

1. Refine the visual design to more closely replicate the demo version.
2. Implement event resizing functionality.
3. Expand theme options to include styles inspired by different operating systems (e.g., Android, iOS).
4. Deepen understanding and implementation of Context API and advanced theming techniques.
